## Build a Blog with Spark

Treehouse Java Web Development Techdegree Project 4

In this project, you will build your own blog using Spark. 
The main (index) page will list blog entry titles with a title and 
date/time created. Each blog entry title will link to a detail page 
that displays the blog entry title, date, body, and comments, along 
with a comment form with that allows anonymous users to post comments. 
Comments will have a name and a body. You should include the ability 
to add or edit blog entries. The edit page should be password-protected 
and will give the ability for an admin to add or edit blog entries. 
Use CSS to make your blog reflect your personal style.
